Arguments are extra pieces of information you give to the script when you run it. These arguments tell the script what to work on.

Imagine you have a food delivery app. You open the app and enter:

Your location → So the food is delivered to the right place.
Your food choice → So the restaurant knows what to prepare.
Your payment method → So the transaction is completed.
Here, the location, food choice, and payment method are like arguments. They help the app process your order correctly.

How Arguments Work in Bash?
When you run a Bash script, you can pass arguments like this:

./script_name.sh argument1 argument2 argument3

script_name.sh → The Bash script you are running.

argument1, argument2, argument3 → Extra information you provide to the script.

Arguments in Bash are like inputs you give to a script when you run it. They help make scripts dynamic and useful for different tasks, like:

Automating calculations 🧮
Processing user data 👤
Running commands with different inputs ⚙️
